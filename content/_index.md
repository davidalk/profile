Hello and welcome to my profile page! My name's David and I'm currently a senior developer working at Regnosys a fintech startup building tools to harmonize the financial regulatory landscape. 

I've been developing professionally since I left university in 2004 but I have been passionate about programming and experimenting with technology since I was a young child; well since my parents purchased a Basic programming book when I was 8 years old so I could try stuff out on the computers at school!

I have a broad range of experience across both front end web technologies and back end systems having moved my focus between different parts of the stack in my career. I like to think that I can get up to speed quickly and start adding value in most tech stacks.

I also take a keen interest in the infrastructure that we run our software on as I believe getting your infrastructure and software architecture to work together effectively is an important aspect of software development. As someone who is equally effective in both front and back end development my experience has came to the fore when working in a cross functional team acting as the glue between specialists.

The aspect of software development that fulfils me the most is that I'm constantly learning and to get the chance to pass on what I have learnt to colleagues makes work truly satisfying.
