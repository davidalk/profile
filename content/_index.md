Hello and welcome to my profile!

My name’s David, and I’m currently a Senior Developer at Regnosys, a fintech startup focused on building tools to harmonize the financial regulatory landscape.

I’ve been developing professionally since 2004, but my passion for programming and technology goes back to when I was a child. At 8 years old, my parents bought me a BASIC programming book, and I began experimenting with computers at school, which sparked my lifelong interest in tech.

Throughout my career, I’ve gained broad experience across both front-end and back-end technologies, often shifting focus across different parts of the stack. I thrive at quickly picking up new tech and adding value in a variety of environments.

I also have a strong interest in the infrastructure that supports our software. I believe effective software architecture and infrastructure are crucial to successful development. Having experience in both front and back end, I’m often the bridge between specialists in cross-functional teams.

The aspect of software development that fulfils me the most is the constant learning. Being able to share what I’ve learned with my colleagues and help them grow is what truly makes the work satisfying for me.
