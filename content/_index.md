Hello and welcome to my profile page! My names David and I'm currently a senior developer working at Unruly a video ad tech company. 

I've been developing professionally since I left university in 2004 but I have been passionate about programming and experimenting with technology since I was a young child, well since my parents purchased a Basic programming book when I was 8 years old so I could try stuff out on the computers at school!

I have a broad range of experience across both front end web technologies and back end systems having moved my focus between different parts of the stack in my career. I like to think that I can get up to speed quickly and start adding value in most tech stacks.

I also take a keen interest in the infrastructure that we run our software on as I believe getting your infrastructure and software architecture to work together effectively is an important aspect of software development. In Unruly this interest lead to me starting the Architecture Guild which I hope has had a positive impact on the company and the people involved.

The aspect of software development that fulfills me the most is that I'm constantly learning. Outside of the technologies I use daily to ship our products I have been improving my functional programming theory by starting to learn Haskell as a member of the Haskell study group at work. I regularly experiment with new languages and development techniques and this has helped me to be a better developer and better able to coach others when they need assistance.
