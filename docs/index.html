          <p>Hello and welcome to my profile page! My name&rsquo;s David and I&rsquo;m currently a senior developer working at Regnosys a fintech startup building tools to harmonize the financial regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been developing professionally since I left university in 2004 but I have been passionate about programming and experimenting with technology since I was a young child; well since my parents purchased a Basic programming book when I was 8 years old so I could try stuff out on the computers at school!</p>
<p>I have a broad range of experience across both front end web technologies and back end systems having moved my focus between different parts of the stack in my career. I like to think that I can get up to speed quickly and start adding value in most tech stacks.</p>
<p>I also take a keen interest in the infrastructure that we run our software on as I believe getting your infrastructure and software architecture to work together effectively is an important aspect of software development. As someone who is equally effective in both front and back end development my experience has came to the fore when working in a cross functional team acting as the glue between specialists.</p>
<p>The aspect of software development that fulfils me the most is that I&rsquo;m constantly learning and to get the chance to pass on what I have learnt to colleagues makes work truly satisfying.</p>

            <p>Regnosys is a fintech who&#39;s goal is to build tooling that encourages the unification of the industry&#39;s various financial models.</p>

                <li>Building new features for the Rosetta Core Editor which is a DSL editor built with an Angular front end and Java back end. The UI is based around the Monaco editor and allows users to edit custom domain models for use within financial regulation.</li>
                
                <li>Tasks include building a dynamic visualisation tool that allows users to visualise financial instruments that they have written in the DSL, sending that DSL to the back end to build a graph structure of related nodes and then returning those nodes to the front end for rendering. I worked font to back on this project.</li>
                
                <li>Worked on a large refactor of the applications ingestion engine that allows users to input financial data in one format and map that to another format, reporting back any mapping or validation errors; a project which also involved front to back work. On the back end I redesigned the ingestion process to increase flexibility and testability. And on the front end myself and a colleague refreshed the UI to give it a more modernised feel as well as bringing in NGRX to handle the complex state management that was needed.</li>
                
                <li>Introduced an end to end testing pipeline built from scratch in Protractor and executed within Codefresh. This pipeline greatly increased deploy confidence after a period of post deployment instability.</li>

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Unruly, London</div>
            <p>Unruly is an Ad Tech company with a focus on video advertising. The product consists of an exchange which connects demand partners (advertisers) to suppliers (publishers) with the aim of maximising revenue for the publishers whilst also providing innovative solutions to buyers to be able to target their desired audience and run their campaign effectively.</p>
            <p>
              <ul class="resume-bullet-list">
                
                <li>Unruly is a strong adherent to XP agile principles and is very committed to delivering value in the thinnest achievable  slice possible to provide the quickest feedback to everyone involved.</li>
                
                <li>Unruly product development has a very open and collaborative culture. For example all work that is committed to production is worked on as a pair, regular tech talks workshops and study groups are held and as a senior developer you are given plenty of opportunity to train more junior team members.</li>
                
                <li>Worked across a number of teams but spent the largest amount of time working on the Ad Spaces team which is focused on delivery of the JavaScript Ad Unit on to the publishers page in as low a bundle size and as performant a manner as possible.</li>
                
                <li>Was tech lead for the Google AMP project which was successful in adding AMP video advertising feature to our product offering opening up a completely new revenue stream. As well as the technical challenges this work also involved collaborating with the Google AMP maintainers to get our integration PR released.</li>
                
                <li>Tech lead for project to migrate our Java based User Syncing service from physical EC2 servers to an ECS container infrastructure. This service handles request volumes upwards of 50 million of requests per day. This was a particularly challenging and interesting project as it required keeping the current infrastructure working during switch over to the new infrastructure, whilst slowly exposing it to more traffic. The new service also had to scale out and in as traffic patterns change across the day and handle sudden traffic spikes. Additionally made use of some interesting technologies such as Java 11 and RX Java which was used to provide a buffered and batched stream of metrics from the service to CloudWatch.</li>
                
                <li>Whilst the largest chunk of my time has been spent in the Ad Spaces teams I have also rotated into most of the other teams, with the longest rotation working on the exchange. This was a great opportunity to refresh my Java skills working on a distributed server side exchange in a functional paradigm using Java 8.</li>
                
                <li>As well as the team rotations I have also worked on ad-hoc feature teams, one of which was tasked with building a UI to allow operations users to interact with a custom DSL for managing domain information. This project was built in the latest version of REACT using a customised Monaco Editor to offer syntax highlighting and error reporting to the user.</li>
                
                <li>Started up and facilitated the architecture guild which is an initiative to allow interested parties to get together and raise issues and bring about change across Unruly architecture. One initiative that came out of this was the creation of a playground AWS account to give people the confidence to experiment without harming any production infrastructure.</li>
